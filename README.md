# Hand-Gestures-controlled-Robot
## Basic Overview:
This repository contains the code, instructions, and resources for building and programming a hand gesture controlled robot using two Arduino boards, MPU6050 gyroscopes, two motors, and kinematic control principles. The robot uses hand gestures detected by the gyroscopes and applies kinematic calculations to control the speed and direction of the motors, enabling precise and intuitive movement.

## Features:
+ **Hand gesture control**:
  - The robot can be controlled using various hand gestures, such as forward, backward, turn left, turn right, and stop.
+ **Real-time control**:
  - The robot responds to hand gestures in real-time, providing a seamless and intuitive control experience.
+ **Kinematic control**:
  - The robot utilizes kinematic calculations to translate hand gesture data into precise motor control commands, ensuring smooth and coordinated movement

## Getting Started:
+ **Hardware Assembly**:
  - Assemble the robot according to the provided instructions.
  - Connect the MPU6050 gyroscopes to the Arduino boards.
  - Connect the motor driver to the Arduino boards and motors.
  - Connect the batteries to the motor driver.
+ **Software Installation**:
  - Download the Arduino IDE and necessary libraries.
  - Download the code from this repository.
  - Upload the code to the Arduino boards.
+ **Calibration**:
  - Calibrate the MPU6050 gyroscopes to ensure accurate gesture recognition. Attach the following link for calibration [Self-Balancing Robot](https://github.com/Ahmed-Emad-123/Self-Balancing-Robot.git)
  - Adjust the kinematic control parameters for smooth and responsive movement.
+ **Testing**:
  - Test the robot's functionality and adjust the control parameters as needed.

## Documentation:
+ **Code documentation**: 
  - Comments and explanations within the code to understand its functionality.
+ **MPU6050 calibration guide**: 
  - Instructions on how to calibrate the gyroscopes.
